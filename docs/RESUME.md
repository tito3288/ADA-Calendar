# ADA Calendar — current handoff

## September 7, 2026 — single real environment and clarification fix

Bryan explicitly chose **one real Supabase project named ADA Calendar and one Railway application**, without separate hosted staging. Keep this choice; do not ask him to recreate projects just for a staging label. Local automated tests remain isolated and never send real mail.

- Existing `main` through `7d96b87` was pushed to the public repository `https://github.com/tito3288/ADA-Calendar` with Bryan's authorization. GitHub Actions run `34132208703` passed both verification jobs. This does not verify the later clarification fix until it is pushed and checked.
- The missing conversational follow-up behavior is now implemented: the browser references an actor-private, server-written pending instruction; a short reply such as “Two hours” retains the original client/task/date. Only clarification results carry context forward. New instructions/dismissal do not replay old commands; typed dismissal needs no AI credentials or budget. Explicit override permissions are never inherited from older turns. Corrected dates survive multiple clarification questions. Context is bounded and new replies expire at the next local day; exact completed-operation retries remain idempotent afterward.
- Added `202609070001_assistant_followups.sql`: one child per pending clarification, checked under the workspace lock, with same-operation retries and author/workspace isolation. The migration applied **in place** to the existing local ADA database without a reset. Extended real local database smoke and SQL lint passed; ADA containers were stopped with volumes preserved, and unrelated SimplAssist services remained untouched.
- Latest unit/server verification: **131 tests in nine files**, lint and generated-route TypeScript checks passed. The repeatable intent script now covers six scenarios, including the two-turn estimate response; it passes in demo mode and has not been run against a live model. Browser and production-container evidence is recorded in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`.
- The host production build hit a local Turbopack port-binding `EPERM`; use the tested Node 24 Docker build as the production artifact, not a claim that the host `npm run check` build succeeded.
- The final frozen application source passed the Node **24.20.0** Docker production build and both network-isolated container smoke modes. Current local image digest is `sha256:38e29426c676b3594bf7094cdc2db585b782269dd9d00ce9da802b53928c1562`; no provider calls or hosted deployment occurred.
- No hosted project, provider key, migration deployment, actual AI call, invitation, stakeholder email, or Railway deployment was performed in this correction turn. Bryan was last on Supabase's project-creation form with the optional GitHub repo selected. Obtain the created project's dashboard URL and inspect its integration/migration state before pushing this new migration or applying it through another path.

**Next:** this correction is saved locally and awaits the next reviewed push. Obtain Bryan's created Supabase dashboard URL, inspect the selected GitHub integration/migration state, then push the correction and guide the single real project's schema/auth setup, Railway GitHub connection and secure environment variables, OpenAI, Resend, and actual integration testing. The optional Supabase GitHub integration may already apply migrations; inspect before applying duplicates. Capture or explicitly allowlist setup mail, then enable normal notifications deliberately. Do not claim real-model performance or hosted delivery is already verified.

## September 7, 2026 — resumed and locally verified

Bryan returned and asked to continue. The September 5 pause is over. All existing source was preserved; the working tree was clean at restart (`21dad63`).

- Re-ran all **17 browser/API tests** successfully after the last implementation changes; desktop/mobile axe checks passed with zero violations, and screenshots were inspected.
- Re-ran lint, generated route types, TypeScript and **108 unit/server tests** successfully.
- Rebuilt `ada-calendar:v1-local` with Node 24 and a successful optimized Next.js build. Added `npm run test:container`, which proves non-root startup, health/static assets, runtime-only configuration, no production demo bypass, and unauthenticated state denial inside disposable **network-isolated** containers. Both containers were removed; unrelated SimplAssist services were untouched.
- Updated `docs/VERIFICATION.md`, README and runbook. No real emails, model calls, invitations, deployments, GitHub repository creation or remote push occurred.
- Bryan has a domain, but has **not yet created the Railway or Supabase projects**. He prefers connecting Railway to GitHub. A private GitHub repository can be created/pushed first; Supabase is a separate hosted project and does not need to exist first.

**Next action:** obtain Bryan's approval and selected account/organization for creating/pushing a private `ada-calendar` GitHub repository (or use an existing repository he supplies). Then connect Railway, create the isolated Supabase environment, securely configure credentials/domain/accounts, and complete the hosted release gates listed in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`. Do not claim that live AI, actual mail, hosted authentication or backup/Storage restoration have already been verified. Do not repeat the full implementation from scratch.

## Historical September 5 pause checkpoint

Saved September 5, 2026 at Bryan's request to pause for the day. **Do not restart implementation or switch hosting platforms.** Resume from the existing code after Bryan returns and asks to continue. Nothing is scheduled to run automatically.

## Outcome so far

The initially empty folder now contains a native Next.js App Router / React / TypeScript / Tailwind application, deterministic scheduler, Supabase backend, voice/text integration, private attachments, request approvals, and durable outgoing email infrastructure. **Hosting is Railway, not Vercel.** Production uses the Node 24 standalone Docker image.

This is a working local implementation with sample data, not a deployed or fully production-verified release. No real OpenAI calls, stakeholder emails, invitations, paid provisioning, or Railway deployment have occurred.

## Latest verified evidence

- Final `npm run check` **passed** after the last implementation changes: full ESLint, `next typegen` plus TypeScript, **108 tests in seven files**, and optimized Next.js production build.
- Last integrated Playwright run: **17/17 API/browser tests passed**, including protected keyboard moves, requester clean fit, conflicts/revised approvals, stale-preview recovery, competing bookings, retries, captured notifications/undo, safe original Markdown attachments, and pending-file retention. Desktop/mobile axe scans had zero violations in the tested screens. Month/day/mobile screenshots were inspected.
- The browser run preceded the final transcription-cost helper and trusted live AI-accounting RPC changes. Those later changes have passing unit/route/database tests, but rerun the browser suite before final handoff.
- All **six** SQL migrations applied successfully to the isolated local ADA Supabase stack. Expanded real database smoke tests passed: invite-only Auth/RLS, transactional outbox/replay, concurrent booking, overlap exclusion, private files, more than 1,000 historical sessions preserved across reads and commits, coherent concurrent schedule snapshots, direct requester protected/history injection denied, and server-only AI ledger/privacy/cache/budget enforcement. SQL lint: zero errors.
- Earlier actual local Edge-worker capture test passed: authentication/method restrictions and six jobs captured/acknowledged. No provider mail was sent.
- Earlier Node 24 Docker image `ada-calendar:v1-local` built and passed production startup checks: setup page 200 without configuration; no production demo bypass; unauthenticated `/api/state` 401; ffprobe available; runtime Supabase configuration exposes sign-in without a rebuild. **Rebuild this image for the final code**, since security/UI/cost changes landed afterward.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: **zero vulnerabilities** reported.
- Five-case deterministic intent evaluation passed, but this is **not a real-model accuracy evaluation**.

## Important recent fixes to preserve

1. Preview fingerprints bind manual bookings and owner approvals to the reviewed semantic plan. Recompute at both the route and final store boundary; reject changed placements with 409 and a fresh preview, including changes caused only by time passing. Ignore regenerated IDs/lifecycle timestamps; retain idempotent retries. UI preserves local edits and handles refreshed previews.
2. Live schedule state is read by authenticated atomic `read_schedule_snapshot` RPC, not separate version/session queries. All sessions are aggregated without the REST 1,000-row cap. This prevents mixed-version overwrites and historical-session loss.
3. Live attachment signing uses the server admin client **only after** an authorized, atomic metadata/limit reservation. Ordinary users have no Storage INSERT authority. Completion/download remain access-checked; originals are immutable/private.
4. AI operation reservation/settlement is service-only, with actor identity obtained from server authentication. Direct authenticated callers cannot forge a zero-cost settlement. Generic `mutate_workspace` reserve/settle actions are blocked in live mode.
5. Only Bryan can explicitly consume interruption reserve, for **any** of the four work categories. Requesters cannot reserve protected, historical/completed, or reserve-consuming sessions through direct SQL RPCs.
6. Scheduling order handles supplied exact sessions first, then hard constraints, effective priority, target date, stable creation time, and ID. Existing commitments/protection remain enforced. Session resizing is not progress; missing effort must still fit.
7. Successful transcription uses server-verified audio duration and a documented cost estimate ($0.0045/minute at verification), with a small padded pre-call reservation. Unknown outcomes retain the reservation. Interpretation uses returned token counts and Standard-tier short/long-context rates. Costs are estimates, not audited invoices. Models remain `gpt-5.6-sol` and `gpt-transcribe`; API credentials are still missing.

## Where to resume

1. Read this file, `docs/BLUEPRINT.md`, `docs/VERIFICATION.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, and current Git status. Preserve all work. The first four phase checkpoints already exist; the pause checkpoint saves the later integrated work.
2. Review the latest changes and finish the verification record. Update phase/evidence wording where earlier entries still describe browser verification as outstanding; do not claim hosted tests happened.
3. Run the final browser suite again, then rebuild the Railway Docker image and repeat bounded startup/auth checks against that exact image. Avoid sharing build output directories between the demo and isolated E2E server.
4. Finish focused reviewable Git checkpoints / final local handoff. No remote push has been requested or performed.
5. Collect real account emails (Bryan/Kyle/William), initial client names/aliases, selected Supabase/Railway project information, credentials through secure environment/provider settings, and a controlled verified sending domain. Do not ask Bryan to paste secrets into chat.
6. Configure isolated hosted staging/capture mode, run actual model/transcription evaluations, hosted invitations/auth, private uploads, Cron/worker, allowlisted delivery, and database **plus Storage-object** restore rehearsal. Enable normal team mail only after these safety gates pass. Production deployment and these external gates are still pending.

## Local environment and cleanup

- Workspace: `/Users/bryanarambula/Projects/ada-calendar`; Git branch `main`; no remote configured by this task.
- Preview: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`, using the development-only sample workspace. The in-app browser is on Month view. The local dev server was left running; if it is no longer available, use `npm run dev`.
- `.env.local` is ignored and contains only demo/capture configuration. `.data/ada-demo.json` is ignored sample persistence. Neither belongs in Git.
- E2E uses port 3100, `.data-e2e`, and `.next-e2e`, isolated from the visible preview. Its server has stopped.
- ADA's local Supabase containers are **stopped**, preserving volumes. The unrelated **SimplAssist** containers were left running and must not be stopped/reset. ADA uses project-specific names and ports 55421–55424.
- An earlier failed generated Next cache was moved recoverably to `/private/tmp/ada-calendar-build-cache-20260905-0840`; it contains no source work and is not a blocker.
- The final verification shell process completed successfully. No further implementation, paid calls, notifications, or deployment should happen while paused.

## Product boundaries not to reopen

Weekdays 9–5 in America/Indiana/Indianapolis; lunch 12–12:30; reserve 16–17; ordinary capacity 6.5h/day. Thin project ribbons consume no capacity; actual sessions do. Completion/progress are explicit. All invited users see shared agency work, with private author drafts/transcripts. Requesters may auto-book only clean fits and cannot edit/delete existing work. Displacement needs Bryan; urgency alone never overrides protection/deadlines. Both Kyle and William receive each committed work update plus a weekly overview. Draft/failure/preview sends nothing. Gmail and Slack reading, public links, and client portals are deferred.
